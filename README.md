This project visualizes the covid 19 data from Germany.

Without this api the project wouldn't have been possible: [https://api.corona-zahlen.org/docs/](https://api.corona-zahlen.org/docs/)

[Live website](https://matzew95.github.io/Covid19-Statistics-Germany/)

Update: This repository doesn't work anymore. The API has changed and doesn't send all needed data anymore.
